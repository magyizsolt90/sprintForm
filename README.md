# sprintForm

**1: UX & UI**
Your layout design left pretty huge wiggle room to think about the design, so I did, that lead me overthink a bit. As a conclusion I decided to create two separate controller for the 2, since I wouldn't bother users with all the transactions history on the main screen. Created a summary view at the top and a friendly greetings label.

I tried to use complementary colors for the project, but if i got the time, I would have picked them from a more trendy palette.

**2: Functions**
Strived to separate things accordingly to apply base coding principles.

**3: Loclization**
I created an english and a hungarian versions of it on an operation system level, not user-level. Meaning: you cannot change language, rather it uses the base op.system lang. If you change your phone language in  factory settings, it changes appropriately.
You can test on XCode too: I created a Sprintform_HUN scheme, so if you change to that before running the code, it compiles the hungarian one.

**+1: You missed clothing category from atteched list and forget to exclude backend tasks from my responsibilities (I hope so :D)**
